# Terraform Google Cloud Storage Module

This module makes it easy to create one or more GCS buckets, and assign basic permissions on them to arbitrary users.

The resources/services/activations/deletions that this module will create/trigger are:

- One or more GCS buckets
- Zero or more IAM bindings for those buckets

If you only wish to create a single bucket, consider using the
[simple bucket](modules/simple_bucket) submodule instead.

## Compatibility
This module is meant for use with Terraform 0.13. If you haven't
[upgraded](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-13.html) and need a Terraform
0.12.x-compatible version of this module, the last released version
intended for Terraform 0.12.x is [v1.7.1](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/-cloud-storage/google/v1.7.1).

## Usage

Basic usage of this module is as follows:

```hcl
module "gcs_buckets" {
  source  = "terraform-google-modules/cloud-storage/google"
  version = "~> 2.2"
  project_id  = "<PROJECT ID>"
  names = ["first", "second"]
  prefix = "my-unique-prefix"
  set_admin_roles = true
  admins = ["group:foo-admins@example.com"]
  versioning = {
    first = true
  }
  bucket_admins = {
    second = "user:spam@example.com,eggs@example.com"
  }
}
```

Functional examples are included in the
[examples](./examples/) directory.
