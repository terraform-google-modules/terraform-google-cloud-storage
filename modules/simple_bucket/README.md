# Terraform Google Cloud Storage Module

This module makes it easy to create a GCS bucket, and assign basic permissions on it to arbitrary users.

The resources/services/activations/deletions that this module will create/trigger are:

- One GCS bucket
- Zero or more IAM bindings for that bucket

## Compatibility

This module is meant for use with Terraform 0.12.

## Usage

Basic usage of this module is as follows:

```hcl
module "bucket" {
  source  = "terraform-google-modules/cloud-storage/google//modules/simple_bucket"
  version = "~> 1.3"

  name       = "example-bucket"
  project_id = "example-project"
  location   = "us-east1"
  iam_members = [{
    role   = "roles/storage.objectViewer"
    member = "user:example-user@example.com"
  }]
}
```

Functional examples are included in the
[examples](../../examples/) directory.
